# APA Style Template (alpha)

## Setup

- Include only authorâ€™s last name in Preferences. This name will be printed in the header

- Include at the beginning of a document:

	1. Full author's name
	2. Professor's name
	3. Class
	4. Date

    End the first 3 lines with two spaces to separate them with a line break, rather than form four paragraphs.
    
- `EXAMPLE.txt` and `EXAMPLE.pdf` contain a sample of markup and the output from iA Writer

## Notes and Works

MultiMarkdown footnotes `[^Lorem ipsum.]` and citations `[p. 23][#Doe:2006]` should be used to cite notes and works. The template will automatically separate them (unlike other templates), and it will alphabetically sort citations. They will be printed on separate pages from the main body of work in printed documents and PDFs.

## Math 

TeX expressions delimited by the classical `$ ... $, $$ ... $$, \( ... \) \[ ... \]` are supported using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).
